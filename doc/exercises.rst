Exercises
=========

We have 3 exercise sessions and 4 exercise groups.  Everybody should complete
at least 3 exercise groups. You can of course try to complete all of them. We
will all start with Git. Python-only programmers can skip the CMake exercise
(which is really only interesting for compiled projects).
