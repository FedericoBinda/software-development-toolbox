Create a CMake framework for a project
======================================

In this exercise we will CMake-ify a project.
This is interesting for people who use Makefiles
or Autotools. Python-only developers can skip
this exercise.

Ideally you should practice CMake on your own
project but we also provide a mockup project
where you can practice CMake: https://github.com/rbast/20-bottles
