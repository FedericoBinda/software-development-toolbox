Project week
============

During the project week you will use what you have learned during the lectures
and hands-on exercises.

Ideally this will be to introduce version control, testing, and documentation
framework for your own project. If you use makefiles then the project can
involve moving to CMake (we highly recommend such a step).

The project work should conclude with a report.

More information about the project week will be added here.
