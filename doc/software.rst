Software that you should install prior to the course
====================================================

- git
- gfortran
- gcc
- g++
- cmake
- python
- virtualenv http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/
- sphinx

If you use Anaconda and are comfortable with it then it is perfectly fine to
use that. In this case you don't have to use virtualenv.

FIXME: We need here more details and examples how to test that
the installation was successful.
